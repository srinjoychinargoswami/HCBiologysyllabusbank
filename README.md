This is a website with access to syllabi from all the Biology Courses (both major and Non-Major) and Co-requisite courses towards the Biology Major. I am making this after being inspired by Computer Science majors and Hunter Students Richard Augill and Jonathan Swift and others who made a website with syllabus directory for Computer Science courses at Hunter College. 

In addition to making the syllabus for various courses available, I will also attach an either google drive or MEGA, or Box folder with all the textbooks from the courses if they are available as PDF's online. I do apologize in advance if its not available for certain courses. Its all about availability.  In addition, if anyone is interesting in attaching their own personal notes to help others, they are more then welcome to do so. My email is listed below.

I would like the most up to date syllabuses as possible meaning from Summer 2019 to Current or when the course was last taught witht the professor who taught it.
